# Forb-Giphy

Forb-Giphy is my project developed using Vue3, Vuetify, and TypeScript. The project aimed to create a small-scale web application serving as an analogue to the renowned Giphy website. Leveraging the official Giphy API, the application seamlessly interacts with a vast database of GIFs, offering users a similar experience to the original platform. Throughout the development process, I utilized modern Vue.js technologies, resulting in an intuitively designed user interface that is both functional and aesthetically appealing.
